# A very useful python script

I Created this script to blend some gradients into a black background, because it felt like no software did what I wanted how I wanted. Well...it turns out making gradients 
really good looking isn't quite as straight forward...so I ended up using existing software. Anyways, this is the script.

## Easy to use

Add the gradients to Gradients-folder and change the names for file paths and run the script👍🏻
